    <div class="gallery-item" data-title="Concrete Tsunami" data-description="2024 National Contemporary Art Prize - Finalist||Concrete Tsunami depicts the pervasive urban development along Australia's coastlines. A clear blue ocean meets a sandy beach, transitioning into a dense suburban landscape characterised by residential dwellings. A road traverses the area, connecting it to a distant cityscape.||However, a monumental concrete wave dominates the scene. This artificial structure, composed of grey and white material, looms over the urban expanse, symbolising the encroachment of development.||The painting's colour palette highlights this contrast: the ocean's blues against the urban hues, with the concrete's grey creating a visual division. Even the sky's blue fails to mitigate the tension.||Concrete Tsunami serves as a metaphor for the rapid expansion of coastal urban areas in Australia. It prompts reflection on the balance between development and environmental preservation, transforming a familiar aerial view into a commentary on the impact of human progress on coastal ecosystems. It is a surreal portrayal, urging viewers to consider the consequences of unchecked development along the Australian coastline.||Width 120.00cm x Height 90.00cm, Oil on Canvas, $1,700.00">

The painting showcases a cluster of grasstrees, their spiky forms standing against a backdrop of snow-dusted mountains.||The artist captures the unique texture of the grasstrees and the dry, ochre-toned earth. A soft, diffused light bathes the scene, highlighting the subtle colours of the landscape. The distant mountains, rendered in soft greys and whites, add depth and draw the viewer's eye into the heart of the reserve.||This painting serves as a poignant reminder of Tidbinbilla's undisturbed beauty, capturing a moment in time before the landscape was forever changed.||Width 101.00cm x Height 76.00cm, Oil on Canvas, $2,150.00">

Are they simply enjoying a peaceful stroll, or is there a sense of purpose to their journey? The artist masterfully uses light and shadow to heighten the intrigue, with the golden hues contrasting against the deep shadows lurking beneath the trees.||The meticulously detailed foliage seems to whisper secrets, while the expressive brushwork hints at unseen movement.

    <div class="gallery-item" data-title="Sunlight On Stone: A Portrait Of Windjana" data-description="The canvas is dominated by the sheer majesty of Windjana Gorge, a vertical slice of ancient history carved by time and water. Towering limestone cliffs rise majestically on either side, their sun-bleached surfaces etched with a thousand wrinkles and crevices. The colours of the rock vary depending on the artist's interpretation, ranging from pale ochre to a rich, reddish brown, hinting at the iron content within. Inclusions of darker grey or black might represent fossilised remnants of creatures long gone. High above, the sky stretches out in a brilliant expanse of blue. The relentless Australian sun beats down, casting the scene in a harsh yet beautiful light.||At the bottom of the gorge, a life-giving ribbon of water winds its way through the landscape. Vegetation clings tenaciously to the crevices in the rock face, adding a splash of emerald green to the otherwise stark palette.||The overall impression is one of awe-inspiring grandeur. The painting captures the raw power and beauty of the Australian landscape, where nature has sculpted the earth over millennia. The juxtaposition of the towering cliffs with the life-giving water creates a sense of contrast and the potential for hidden life within the gorge.||Width 50.00cm x Height 60.00cm, Oil on Canvas, SOLD">
